## AAC Configuration File (Generated by AAC 5.0.0)
#
# How AAC works:
#   AAC's detection pipeline has three main stages: checks, database, and analysis
#    - Checks analyse player behaviour and record any interesting data available.
#      Some checks are additionally able to block cheats from being used. This is called mitigation.
#    - The database stores a record of aggregate information generated by all enabled checks for every player.
#      Old entries are automatically cleared when the server restarts.
#    - AAC periodically analyses each player's database entries, generating an overall risk score and a report.
#      If the generated risk score is greater than a configured threshold (see `yellow_score`, `red_score`), an alert
#      is shown. The detailed report can be viewed by clicking the alert, or by running /aac status <player>.
#
#   AAC takes many factors into account when generating its reports. These can be viewed, weighted, or disabled in
#   the `features` section of this file. Metadata about each feature can be viewed by hovering over the output in
#   /aac status <player>.
#
#   You can ask AAC to immediately generate a report for any player with /aac check <player>, and you can clear all
#   stored data for a player with /aac reset <player>. A list of all online players can be seen with /aac status.
#   Any colour coded player name sent in chat by AAC can be clicked for a detailed report.
#
# Silent mode:
#   Normally, AAC prevents certain cheats from working on your server, such as fly and nofall. If you do not want
#   AAC to block cheats at all, you can set the `mitigate` option in every check to `false`. In addition, if you do
#   not want to block nofall, you can set the `block_nofall` option to `false` in the move check.
#
#   You will still receive alerts from checks with mitigation disabled. If you want to disable a check entirely, you
#   can set the `enabled` option to false.
#
#   If you want to exempt any particular player from AAC entirely, you can use the /aac exempt <player> command.
#   This command persists through reboots and even between servers, if they are connected to the same database.
#
# Localisation:
#   By default, AAC never sends any messages to players. AAC's alerts include only the offending player's name and
#   hence do not need to be localised either. However, you may wish to translate the output of /aac status <player>
#   to make it easier for moderators to understand.
#   The text used for these is available in the `features` section of this configuration file.
#
# In this configuration file, all length units are blocks and all time units are seconds

# By default, AAC will use an SQLite database stored in its plugin data folder. MySQL support can be enabled here.
# All created tables have the prefix 'aac_'
