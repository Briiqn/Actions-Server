#Here you can combine multiple number placeholders into one!
#Operator precedence is taken into account, so these are the same:
#5 + (3 * %player_health%)
#5 + 3 * %player_health%
#And multiplication operators can usually be left out:
#5 + 3%player_health%
Formulas:
  #Shows what you can do, though it's completely pointless:
  #square(x) is a shortcut for (x * x)
  #mod is modulus. 128 mod 100 = 28, 7 mod 4 = 3
  overkill: '101(((4(5 + 3%player_food_level%) / square(2)) - 5) / 3) mod 100'
  useless:
    #sqrt(x) is the square root of x, so sqrt(4) gives 2 and sqrt(16) gives 4
    value: 'sqrt(%player_health% * %player_health%)'
    #You can specify format per-formula, or (see the bottom) use the global format

#Here you can declare your SQL databases
#Databases:
#  testdb:
#    # Should start with jdbc:mysql:// for mysql databases
#    url: 'jdbc:mysql://localhost/test'
#    user: 'host'
#    password: ''

#Sql-Queries:
#  #5 second refresh delay (default value)
#  Refresh-Delay: 5
#  #How to use:
#  #Use %animlib_sql_test% to retrieve the last stored value
#  #Use %animlib_sqlrefresh_test% to retrieve the last value, and request it to be refreshed for the player
#  test:
#    #The database name, as specified under Databases
#    Database: testdb
#    #The SQL query, very important ;3
#    Query: "SELECT `Name` FROM `test` WHERE `UUID`='%player_uuid%'"
#    Default: '%player_name%'
#    #The amount of times the value can be used before forgetting it.
#    #When 0 (the default value), it will not expire until the player leaves
#    Lifespan: 1
#    #Should this be requested when a player joins?
#    Request-On-Join: true
#    #Should it automatically be refreshed as specified by Refresh-Delay?

#    #The processor of the received data. You get a variable called 'sql' which is a ResultSet
#    #See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html
#    Script:
#    - "sql.next();" #Go to the first result
#    - "sql.getString('Name');" #The last line specifies what to return, in this case the Name field
#The formula locale to use (default, even when not specified, is english)
#This can make, for example:
#100,000.123 in english
#100.000,123 in german
#100 000,123 in french
